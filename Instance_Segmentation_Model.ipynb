Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that combines object detection and semantic segmentation. The goal is to identify and label each individual object instance within an image or video with a unique color. The requirement is to submit a video where each detected object instance is represented by a distinct color. A detailed document explaining the steps taken in the process is also necessary. While submitting code is optional, it's an option to showcase the implementation.\n",

Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that combines object detection and semantic segmentation. The goal is to identify and label each individual object instance within an image or video with a unique color. The requirement is to submit a video where each detected object instance is represented by a distinct color. A detailed document explaining the steps taken in the process is also necessary. While submitting code is optional, it's an option to showcase the implementation.\n",

This inspection involved a dual approach, combining both manual and automated mechanisms. Manual inspection of a representative subset of images and corresponding masks revealed major anomalies, such as misaligned annotations and potential data corruption, providing valuable insights into the dataset's characteristics. Additionally, automated code was employed to efficiently check for missing images and detect discrepancies in dimensions between images and masks. This automated approach generated summary statistics, including image sizes and class distributions, aiding in the initial assessment of data quality. By combining manual scrutiny with automated validation, the dataset was thoroughly examined for any inconsistencies, errors, or anomalies, setting a robust foundation for subsequent preprocessing and model training."
